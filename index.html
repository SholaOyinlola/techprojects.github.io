											<h3>Redox Airlines Growth Internship Case</h3>
											<p>Redox Airline a small startup airline, operating out of the Chicago, Illinois area in the United States. 
												The airline's management team has a strong airline operations background, but do not have much financial or data analytics experience. Many of their systems are disparate and not connected. Until just recently, the airline could not pull specific aircraft details, such as route and seating capacity, from a single report, but rather needed to open two or more files and compare the information.
												This project however analyzes the data and present key insights to drive the business growth and position in the industry while addressing the problems of inappropriate record keeping in a consolidated and meaningly manner
